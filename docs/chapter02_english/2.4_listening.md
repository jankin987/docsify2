## 2.4.1 
### **ACT 1-1 “我可以给您和您的小男孩拍张照吗？”**

**【故事梗概】**

自由摄影艺术家Richard Stewart，正在为编出自己的影集《走遍美国》到处拍照。今天他在由纽约市曼哈顿区到斯塔滕岛的渡船上工作，回程中遇到了来自加州的一位黑人妇女Martha Vann和她的小儿子Gerald。Richard想要给他们拍照。

Richard: Excuse me. My name is Richard Stewart. I'm a photographer. May I take a picture of you and your little boy?<br>
Mrs.Vann: What's it for? <br>
Richard: It's for a book.<br>
Mrs.Vann: You're writing a book?<br>
Richard: It's a book of pictures. I call it Family Album, U.S.A.<br>
Mrs.Vann: Oh, that's a nice idea. Well, it's fine if you take our picture. I'm Martha Vann.<br>
Richard: Thank you. I appreciate your help. I'm Richard. What's your name?<br>
Gerald: Gerald.<br>
Richard: How old are you, Gerald?<br>
Gerald: Five.<br>
Richard: And where do you live?<br>
Mrs.Vann: We live in California.<br>
Richard: Well, welcome to New York. OK, just a second. I'm almost ready here.<br>

**【语言点精讲】**

**1. Excuse me. My name is Richard Stewart. I'm a photographer.**<br>
这是Richard在与陌生人搭讪并介绍自己。<br>
Excuse me 这个短语用来引起对方的注意。相当于汉语的“对不起，劳驾”。<br>
自我介绍时可以先介绍自己的名字，再说明自己的职业。<br>
介绍自己的名字时，可以像Richard一样，说My name is Richard Stewart.<br>
也可以像Mrs. Vann那样，说I'm Martha Vann.<br>

**2. May I take a picture of you and your little boy?**<br>
May I...是一种很礼貌的征求别人的同意的说法，相当于“我可以...吗？”。<br>
Richard 想要为Mrs. Vann 母子拍照片，他首先要征得当事人的同意，否则闹出肖像权的问题可不是好玩滴~~<br>

**3. I appreciate your help.**<br>
这是在受别人帮助或听了别人的忠告之后的感谢语。在Richard向Mrs. Vann说明了照片的用途后，Mrs. Vann欣然接受拍照的请求，之后Richard立即向对方表达了感谢。这里也可以说I really appreciate it.

**4. Welcome to New York.**<br>
Welcome to… 是迎接客人的客套语。Richard与Mrs. Vann母子攀谈几句后得知母子二人来自于California，于是Richard对他们说，欢迎到纽约来。<br>
又例如：Welcome to HJ English. 

**【词汇句式拓展】**

**1. Excuse me.** <br>
**释义：**① 有礼貌地引起注意；②打断他人说话而抱歉Excuse me interrupting；③离开或停止与其交谈；④失陪；⑤借过；⑥失礼道歉；⑦请再说一遍；⑧反对；⑨打扰一下。

**2. Great! / Terrific! / Nice!**<br>
在拍照的过程中，Mrs.Vann母子每在他的要求下摆一个新的姿势，Richard都会对他们的配合给予肯定。他用到的"Great! Terrific! Nice!" 都是用来表示“太好了，好极了，很好”的意思。

在交谈中，Alexandra 表示希望了解一下Richard 的书。于是Richard向她展示了自己为这本书拍的一些照片。同时，Richard也向她展示了自己家人的照片。

Richard: Your English is very good.<br>
Alexandra: Thanks. I studied English in school.<br>
Richard: Would you like some coffee?<br>
Alexandra: No, thank you. Tell me about your book.<br>

Richard: Thanks. <br>

**【语言点精讲】**

**1. Would you like some coffee?**

Would you like...相当于“你想要...吗？”，在客气地请对方做某事或请客时用。<br>
如本文中，Richard问Alexandra“想来一点咖啡吗”，他说 "Would you like some coffee?"<br>
在谈到自己的书Family Album, U.S.A.时，他问对方“想要看一看吗”，"Would you like to see them?" <br>
如果我们不想接受，就说"No, thank you."<br>
如果愿意接受，则说"Yes. I'd like that." 或者"Yes. Please."<br>

**2. Here they are.**

把东西给别人看时用。单数时用 Here it is.<br>

**3. Thanks.**

在本情境中出现的两次"Thanks"都是对于别人赞美的回应。<br>
称赞对方，或对方的家人，是美国人很重要的一种社交习惯，被人称赞时，要表示乐于接受并愉快地感谢，不要急于否认或自贬，也不要表现得扭捏不安。所以无论是人家说你的英语好--"Your English is very good."，还是称赞你的夫人很漂亮--"Oh, she's very pretty."，都不必不好意思，只要说声 "Thank you" 就可以了。 <br>
